# Twitter-Reviews-App-iOS
App made for final project of mobile apps development class.


Incoporates Fabric's TwitterKit to pull review from Twitter's search API.
User can place a pin on the map, name the pin whatever they want, and perform a WebView Google search of the name and/or a Twitter search for
Tweets containg that name.

The plan was for users to mark restaraunts on the map, and be able to search for that restaraunt for Twitter reviews or a Google search all from
within the app. However, no Heuristic Analysis is performed on the contents of the Tweets, so the Tweets could be about anything. Also,
the app does not consider locale or language of the Tweets.
